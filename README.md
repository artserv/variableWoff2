# variableWoff2
Variable ttf and woff2 font-family with results I took the two ttf Piazzolla variable fonts from GoogleFonts and had my nephew convert them (the Roman and Italic fonts) to the woff2 format. The purpose of this website is to demonstrate the viability of displaying these two fonts over the internet, using the simple and (inadequate) CSS font-face procedure.
